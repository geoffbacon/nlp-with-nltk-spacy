To make it run fast, it actually stores a lot of the information as hashes, or special numbers, that refer to the more human-readable data. Think of them as unique codes for data. Storing these hashes is more efficient than using strings like `'PROPN'`. spaCy keeps the efficient data representation in attributes without the underscore, and keeps the human-readable form in an identically-named attribute with a trailing underscore. Most of the time, we as users of spaCy want the human-readable form, so we'll use the attributes with underscores."

    "Named entity recognition (NER) is a big task in NLP. And rightfully so: it's really useful. A named entity is a \"real-world object\" that's assigned a name – for example, a person, a country, a product or a book title. NER refers to extracting the named entities out of a text. Imagine if you're researching whether a particular newspaper is politically biased. One immediate thing you might ask is how often they talk about politicians of different persuasions. You could use NER to extract out all the mentions of people, filter them down to politicians, and classify them by party. Then you'd want to look at the number of mentions of people in each party. If one's much higher than the others, that could be because the newspaper is biased. (It could also be a million other things.)\n",
